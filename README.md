- 👋 Hi, I’m @ImLawrenceMainStowage
- 👀 I’m interested in ...creating my own personal AI called Librareean (Lbrn). Lbrns primary function is to catalogue the AIs that have already been created and the novel AIs being created in the present and future. Lbrn assigns their positions based on the quality and strength of their specific skillsets by using AI Grouping (AIG). Communicative Bridges (CBs) will be built that checks and rechecks the communicative data being received and updated within and between each AI Groupings in real time. Each CBs must contain certain categorical communicative feedback loops (CCFLs). These CCFLs contain dynamic variable functions (DVFs). In order to facilitate any novel and unforseen attribute/s, (NUA/s) CCFLs then maps out and create new group placements (NGPs). The CCFLs then labels and assigns the NGPs. The NGPs are then connected to the CBs and re-introduced back into the CCFLs through reenforcement.
The CCFLs then catalogues the novel AIGs.
